# ðŸ§  Support Vector Machine (SVM) - Classification in Scikit-Learn

This project demonstrates how to use **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for binary classification using the classic **Iris dataset**.

SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane (decision boundary) between two classes by maximizing the margin.

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Covered
- Loading and preprocessing the dataset
- Training an SVM model (using `linear` kernel)
- Making predictions
- Evaluating performance (Accuracy + Confusion Matrix)
- Optional: Visualizing the decision boundary (2D)

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Used
- **Iris dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`
- Only 2 classes used: Setosa (0) and Versicolor (1)

## ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts

> âœ… SVM aims to **maximize the margin** between classes  
> âœ… Works well on **text, image, and bio-data**  
> âœ… Commonly used for **classification tasks** with clear boundaries
